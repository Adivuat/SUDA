**2: Did you make a lot of friends when you were a child?**

- Well, I wouldn't say I had a huge circle of friends when I was younger. I was more of a homebody and preferred spending time with a small group of close friends. We had a really deep bond and shared almost everything with each other.

**3: Have you made any new friends recently?**

- Yes, I would say so. Before university, my opportunities to meet new people were quite limited. But since starting my studies, I've been exposed to a much more diverse group of individuals, which has been really enriching.



## Q2: Teamwork
### Part 1

**1. Do you like teamwork?**

- Well, it depends on the situation. I don't always find teamwork to be the most efficient way to work. When you're in a team, you often have to consider multiple perspectives and try to find a solution that everyone can agree on. I find it quite challenging to balance everyone's needs and expectations.

**2. Have you teamed up with someone else before?**

- Yes, definitely. I've been part of a few group projects, especially during my time in school. For instance, we often had to collaborate on engineering assignments, where we worked together to solve technical problems. It was a great learning experience, but it also highlighted the challenges of working with others.

**3. What do you learn from working in a team?**

- Working in a team has taught me a lot about communication, compromise, and the importance of different perspectives. I've learned how to effectively delegate tasks, resolve conflicts, and adapt to changing circumstances. It's also helped me to develop my interpersonal skills, such as active listening and empathy.

**4. What do you dislike about teamwork?**

- One of the biggest challenges I've encountered in teamwork is dealing with differing opinions and work styles. It can be frustrating when team members have different ideas about how to approach a problem, or when someone isn't pulling their weight. Additionally, it's often difficult to keep everyone on the same page and ensure that all tasks are completed on time.



## Q3: Place of work/study

**2. What is your favourite place to study?**

- Actually, my favorite place to study is a secluded corner in the lab. I find that having access to research materials and equipment can be very stimulating, and the lab environment helps me to stay focused on my work.

**3. What part of your school do you like the most?**

- What I appreciate most about my school is the freedom it gives students. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of when and where we study, which allows us to create a personalized learning experience.

**4. Do you prefer to work at home or in the workplace?**

- I prefer working in a workplace. I find that being surrounded by colleagues and having a dedicated workspace can boost my productivity and motivation. Also, the social interactions at work provide valuable emotional support.

**5. Do you prefer to work alone or in a group?**

- I tend to prefer working alone, especially as a student. I'm still in the process of acquiring new skills and knowledge, so I find that working independently allows me to focus better and learn at my own pace. Large-scale projects that require teamwork can be valuable, but for now, I find solo work to be more efficient.



## Q4: Good View
### Part 1

**1. What is the view like around the place where you live?**

I often see locals strolling along the banks of the canals, enjoying the serene atmosphere. The classical Chinese architecture and lush greenery create a harmonious and tranquil scene.

**2. Have you seen an unforgettable and beautiful view or scenery?**

- Yes, I’ve been to Mount Lu, and it was truly an unforgettable experience. The majestic mountains, cascading waterfalls, and mist-covered peaks create a breathtaking landscape. I was particularly captivated by the sea of clouds that seemed to engulf the entire mountain range.

**3. Would you take photos when you see a good view?**

- Absolutely! I love capturing beautiful moments through photography. While memories can fade over time, photos serve as tangible reminders of special experiences. Whenever I look back at my travel photos, I feel a sense of joy and nostalgia.

**4. What is your favorite place? Why?**

- I'd have to say Chengdu. The city has a unique charm with its relaxed pace of life, delicious cuisine, and rich cultural heritage. I particularly love the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base, where I can get up close to these adorable creatures. Chengdu's friendly locals and the city's vibrant atmosphere always make me feel at home.

## Q5:Perfume
### Part 1

**1. Do you like perfume?**

- It's a bit of a mixed bag for me. I appreciate a good fragrance, but I'm not really a perfume expert. I think some perfumes can be very pleasant, especially when they're subtle and don't overpower a room. However, I'm quite sensitive to strong scents, so I need to be careful about the types of perfumes I choose.

**2. Do you use perfume?**

- Not regularly. I used to experiment with different fragrances when I was younger, but nowadays, I prefer a more natural scent. I find that simple things like body lotion or a nice-smelling shampoo are enough for me.

**3. Where do you spray perfume?**

- Since I don't wear perfume very often, I can't say for sure. But if I were to, I'd probably spray it on my wrists or behind my ears. I've heard that these are the best places to apply perfume, as the body heat helps to diffuse the scent.

**4. Do you send perfume to others as a gift?**

- Yes, sometimes. Perfume can be a thoughtful gift, especially for someone who appreciates fine fragrances. However, I usually only give perfume as a gift if I know the person's taste very well. It can be a bit risky to choose a fragrance for someone else, as everyone's preferences are different.

**5. Do you spend a lot of money on buying perfume?**

- Not at all. As I mentioned, I don't use perfume very often, so there's no need for me to invest in expensive bottles. When I do buy perfume, I usually opt for more affordable options or look for special deals.



## Q6: Teachers

### Part 1

**1. Do you have a favorite teacher?**

- Yes, I do. I had an amazing chemistry teacher in high school. He had a real knack for making even the most complex concepts seem easy to understand. Plus, he was always so patient and encouraging, which really helped me to build my confidence.

**2. In what way has your favorite teacher helped you?**

- He really helped me through a tough patch in chemistry. I was struggling with the subject at first, but he took the time to explain things in a different way, and that really made a difference. He was also like a mentor to me. We would often talk about life outside of class, and his positive outlook on life had a big impact on me.

**3. Do you have a teacher from your past that you still remember?**

- This question is similar to the first one, but it's asking for a broader perspective. While my chemistry teacher was definitely my favorite, there are other teachers who have left a lasting impression on me. For example, my primary school English teacher, was very creative and made learning fun.

**4. Are you still in touch with your primary school teachers?**

- Yes, I am actually. I try to reconnect with my primary school teachers whenever I go back home. We usually have a get-together and catch up on each other's lives. It's always nice to reminisce about old times and see how everyone is doing.

**5. Do you want to be a teacher in the future?**

- While I appreciate the work that teachers do, I don't think I'm cut out to be one myself. I admire their patience and ability to connect with students, but I think I'd rather pursue a career in a more technical field.





## Q7: Fishing

### Part 1

**1. Is fishing popular in your country?**

- Yes, fishing is quite popular in my country. You can often see people fishing by lakes and rivers, especially during weekends or holidays. It's a common pastime for many, and it's considered a relaxing and enjoyable activity.

**3. Do you like fishing?**

- I'm not sure if I would enjoy fishing. I've never actually tried it before, but I imagine it would require a lot of patience, which isn't one of my strong suits. Plus, I'm not very fond of being outdoors for extended periods.

**4. Did you ever go fishing when you were a child?**

- No, I never went fishing as a child. My parents weren't really into outdoor activities, and I spent most of my free time playing video games or reading books.

- I wouldn't say I'm particularly funny. I can appreciate humor and enjoy a good joke, but I'm not the type of person who is always cracking jokes or trying to be the center of attention.

**3. Are you a person who often makes others laugh?**

- Not really, I'm actually quite introverted. I tend to be more of a listener than a talker. However, I do enjoy sharing funny stories or memes with my friends, especially if I think they'll appreciate them.

**4. Do you always laugh at funny things?**

- Most of the time, yes. I'm a big fan of short videos on platforms like TikTok, and they often have really funny content that makes me laugh out loud.

## Q9: Roads and streets

### Part 1

**1. Are the roads and streets in the area where you live busy?**

- Yes, the roads and streets in my area can get quite congested, especially during rush hour. Commuting to work or school can be a real challenge as the traffic is often heavy. There are always a lot of cars, buses, and bicycles on the road.

**2. How do people cross the road in the city where you live?**

- People in my city are generally pretty good at following traffic rules. Most people will wait for the green light before crossing the road. Pedestrians are also encouraged to use designated crosswalks for their safety.

**3. What is the condition of the roads in your city like?**

- Suzhou is known for its well-maintained roads. Most of the main roads are wide and smooth, making driving a pleasant experience. However, some of the smaller, older streets can be a bit narrow and have potholes, especially during the winter months.

**4. Do you think the roads in your city need improvement?**

- While Suzhou's roads are generally good, there is always room for improvement. For example, some areas could benefit from more bike lanes to encourage people to use more environmentally friendly modes of transportation. Additionally, improving the public transportation system would help to reduce traffic congestion.

**5. Are there any famous roads or streets in your country?**

- Yes, there are many famous roads and streets in China. In my hometown, Suzhou, the Pingjiang Road is particularly well-known. It's a historic pedestrian street lined with traditional Chinese buildings and canals. It's a popular tourist destination and a great place to experience the city's rich culture.





## Q10: Coins

### Part 1

**4. Do you use coins in your daily life?**

- Not really. I try to avoid using coins whenever possible. As I mentioned earlier, mobile payments are much more efficient and convenient. The only times I might use coins is when I'm buying something from a vending machine or if I'm paying for something at a very small, local shop that doesn't accept digital payments.

**5. Did you use coins as a child?**

- Yes, I definitely used coins more frequently when I was a child. Back then, mobile payments weren't as widespread, so we had to rely on cash for most transactions. I remember saving up my coins to buy toys or snacks.




## Q11: Bikes

### Part 1

**1. Did you have a bike when you were young?**

- Yes, I did. I had a bright yellow bicycle that was my constant companion throughout my primary and middle school years. I would ride it everywhere, from school to the park, and even on long trips with my friends.

**2. Do you have a bike now?**

- Unfortunately, I don't have a bike anymore. Since my university campus is quite small and I live in a city with a well-developed public transportation system, I haven't really needed one. Plus, with the convenience of ride-sharing services, it's easy to get around without owning a bicycle.

**3. Do you often ride a bike now?**

# Q1:购物服务

## Part 2

### Describe a time when you received good service in a shop/store.

**Your Response:**

"Okay, let me tell you about a time I received excellent customer service at a supermarket called "Huarun Sugo" in my hometown, Suqian. Before I left for university, I was a regular customer there, almost visiting once a week.

What I really appreciated about Huarun Sugo was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. There was one particular cashier who always had a smile on her face. She would often greet me by name and ask about my day. Once, I was looking for a specific type of tea that they didn't have in stock. Without hesitation, she offered to help me find it in another store or order it for me.

I was also impressed by the store's overall cleanliness and organization. The shelves were always well-stocked, and the products were neatly arranged. The store also had a great selection of fresh produce and a bakery that made delicious bread and pastries.

The convenience and quality of service at Huarun Sugo made my shopping experience enjoyable. I felt valued as a customer, and I was always happy to return. It's a great example of how good customer service can make a big difference."

### Part 3

**1. Why are shopping malls so popular in China?**

Shopping malls have become incredibly popular in China due to a combination of factors. Firstly, they offer a convenient one-stop shopping experience, where consumers can find a wide variety of goods and services under one roof. Secondly, malls have become social hubs, providing entertainment options like cinemas, food courts, and arcades. Moreover, they are often air-conditioned and offer a comfortable shopping environment, especially during hot summers or cold winters. Lastly, many Chinese people view shopping as a leisure activity, and malls provide a pleasant atmosphere to spend time with friends and family.

**2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of shopping in small shops?**

Shopping in small shops has both its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, small shops often offer a more personalized shopping experience, with friendly and knowledgeable staff. They may also carry unique products that are not available in larger stores. However, small shops may have limited product selection and may be more expensive. Additionally, they may not offer the same level of convenience as larger stores, such as extended hours or online shopping options.

**3. Why do some people not like shopping in small shops?**

There are a few reasons why some people may prefer not to shop in small shops. Firstly, small shops may have a limited selection of products, especially for popular brands or items. Secondly, the quality of products in small shops can be inconsistent, and customers may have concerns about product authenticity. Additionally, some people may find small shops to be less convenient, as they may have limited hours or be located in less accessible areas.

**4. What are the differences between online shopping and in-store shopping?**

Online shopping and in-store shopping offer distinct experiences. Online shopping provides the convenience of shopping from anywhere at any time, with a vast selection of products available at competitive prices. However, it can be difficult to assess the quality of products without seeing them in person, and there may be shipping costs and longer wait times for delivery. In-store shopping allows customers to physically examine products, get immediate assistance from staff, and enjoy the social aspect of shopping. However, it can be time-consuming and may involve crowds, especially during peak shopping times.

**5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of shopping online?**

The advantages of online shopping include a wider selection of products, competitive prices, and the convenience of shopping from home. Additionally, online retailers often offer personalized recommendations and easy returns. However, there are also some disadvantages, such as the inability to physically examine products, potential shipping costs, and the risk of fraud or receiving damaged goods.

**6. Can consumption drive economic growth?**

Yes, consumption can indeed drive economic growth. When consumers spend money on goods and services, it stimulates demand for products, which in turn encourages businesses to produce more. This increased production leads to job creation and economic growth. However, excessive consumption can also lead to negative consequences, such as environmental damage and increased debt. Therefore, it's important to balance economic growth with sustainable consumption practices.






# Q2:看到野生动物的地方

## **Part 2

### Describe a place in your city you have been to where you can see wildlife

"I'd like to talk about Hongshan Zoo in Nanjing, a place that holds a special place in my heart. Although it might not be considered a 'true' wildlife sanctuary, it was my go-to spot for animal encounters during my childhood.

I have countless memories of visiting the zoo, marveling at the diversity of animals from all over the world. From the majestic lions and tigers to the playful pandas and the exotic birds, there was always something new and exciting to discover. I remember being particularly fascinated by the pandas, watching them lazily munch on bamboo shoots.

The zoo not only provided me with opportunities to learn about different animal species but also taught me the importance of conservation. Seeing these animals up close made me realize the fragility of our planet and the need to protect wildlife. Even though I'm older now, I still enjoy visiting Hongshan Zoo whenever I have the chance."

## **Part 3:**

1. **Why are most children interested in wild animals?** 
   Children are naturally curious about the world around them, and animals represent a fascinating part of nature. Wild animals often possess unique characteristics and behaviors that captivate children's imaginations. Plus, many children's stories and cartoons feature animal characters, which can spark their interest in the real-life counterparts.
2. **Should parents take their children to the zoo to see wild animals?** 
   Zoos can be a great way to introduce children to the animal kingdom and foster a love for nature. However, it's important to choose reputable zoos that prioritize animal welfare and education. By visiting zoos, children can learn about different species, their habitats, and the threats they face.
3. **Are wild animals easy to spot in your country?** 
   In many urban areas of China, it's becoming increasingly difficult to spot wild animals due to urbanization and habitat loss. However, in more rural areas and protected natural reserves, there are still opportunities to encounter wildlife, such as pandas in Sichuan or monkeys in Yunnan.
4. **Are there many wildlife documentaries produced in your country?** 
   Yes, there are a growing number of wildlife documentaries produced in China. These documentaries often focus on the country's unique biodiversity, such as the giant panda, the Chinese alligator, and various bird species. They play a crucial role in raising awareness about wildlife conservation and inspiring people to protect the natural environment.
5. **What impacts does only seeing wild animals in zoos have on children's understanding of these animals?** 
   While zoos offer a valuable learning experience, seeing animals only in captivity can limit children's understanding of these creatures. Wild animals in zoos often live in artificial environments and may exhibit abnormal behaviors. This can lead children to develop unrealistic expectations about wildlife and underestimate the challenges that wild animals face in their natural habitats.
6. **Which is the better way to see wildlife, watching documentaries or going into the wild?** 
   Both watching documentaries and going into the wild offer unique benefits. Documentaries provide a comprehensive overview of different species and their behaviors, while experiencing wildlife in their natural habitats allows for a more immersive and personal connection. Ideally, a combination of both would be best. Children can learn about wildlife through documentaries and then apply that knowledge when they visit zoos or wildlife parks.
