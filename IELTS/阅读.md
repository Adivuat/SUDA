**Question 1: What is the main idea of the passage?**

The main idea of the passage is to outline the historical development and key milestones in the evolution of urban planning, from ancient times to the present day, highlighting the impact of various social, economic, and technological changes on city design and management.

**Question 2: According to the text, what were the key factors that led to the development of modern urban planning?**

The key factors that led to the development of modern urban planning included the rapid population growth in cities due to industrialization, the need for improved sanitation and living conditions to combat diseases, and the recognition of the importance of organized city layouts for efficient transportation and economic growth.

**Question 3: How did the Industrial Revolution impact urban planning?**

The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on urban planning by accelerating urbanization and creating densely populated cities with new industrial needs. This led to the development of specialized zones for industry, residential areas, and commercial spaces, as well as the introduction of infrastructure such as railways and sewers to support the growing urban population.

**Question 4: What role did the Great Fire of London play in the evolution of urban planning?**

The Great Fire of London in 1666 played a significant role in the evolution of urban planning by providing a catalyst for the re-design of the city. It led to the implementation of stricter building codes, the introduction of wider streets to prevent the rapid spread of fire, and the use of more fire-resistant materials in construction, all of which contributed to the development of safer and more organized urban environments.

**Question 5: Describe the concept of "garden cities" as mentioned in the passage.**

The concept of "garden cities" refers to the idea of creating self-contained communities that integrate green spaces, residential areas, and industrial zones in a balanced manner. Proposed by Ebenezer Howard in the late 19th century, garden cities aimed to combine the advantages of both town and country living by providing residents with access to nature while also offering the amenities and economic opportunities of urban areas. This approach sought to address the overcrowding and pollution problems associated with traditional industrial cities.
